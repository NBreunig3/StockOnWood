Might have to add OwnedPositionId to the table so that you can use it for Order sell to sell specific position
Will have to thread Refresher and OrderProcessor
Update Accounts table
 - Change Value column to MarketValue which is = sum of owned positions MarketValue
 - Add column NetValue = MarketValue + ProfitLoss
