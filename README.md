# StockOnWood

A project created for my databases class at University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. </br>
By Nathan Breunig. 

### Description

This application was designed to simulate an online brokerage system like Vanguard or Fidelity. It allows users to sign up for an account and use that account to buy & sell stocks. The four most common order types are supported: market, limit, stop-loss, stop-limit. A user is also able to see their profit/loss on idividual positions as well as their overall account. All of the users and application data is stored in an SQLite database.
